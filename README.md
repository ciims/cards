# CiiMS Card Repository

This repository contains a collection of all the approved dashboard cards that can be installed through the [CiiMS Dashboard](https://github.com/charlesportwoodii/ciims-modules-dashboard), and serves as the primary distribution center for all dashboard cards.

## How this repository works

This repository contains an ```index.json``` file, which contains a master list of all the approved dashboard cards for CiiMS. In the dashboard, when you look to install a new card, this file is referenced as the master approved list of cards that can be installed.

When new cards are added, and automated process kicks off on https://cards.ciims.io to download all cards listed in the ```index.json``` file and push it to a persistent CDN for long term storage. This storage is never purged, so if you want to make a change to your card you'll need to publish a new git tag/version of your card, and submit a new pull request to update the version. Once your updated is approved your card will be pushed to all CiiMS instances as an available update.

## Contributing

To contribute to this repository, first build  a dashboard card (see https://github.com/charlesportwoodii/ciims-basic-card as an example of what a card looks and can do). Once you are happy with your card, tag/version it using [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/). Once versioned, submitted a pull request to this repository. Your pull request should modify ```index.json``` with your card information, and should have the following information at minimum.

```
"BasicCard": {
	"repository": "https://github.com/charlesportwoodii/ciims-basic-card",
	"version": "1.0.0"
}
```

The ```repository``` field can be any publicly available github repository, and the ```version``` should correspond to a published git tag.

## Run your own card repository
Want to run your own card repository for CiiMS instances you manage? CiiMS now lets you specify a custom card repository endpoint and run a private set of cards.

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone the forked repository to your server
3. Edit index.json as you see fit
4. Run ```php parser.php``` to initially populate the database
5. Add ```parser.sh``` to an hourly crontab on your system
6. Make the cloned folder accessible via HTTP
7. In CiiMS#/protected/config/main.php, add the following key value pair to the ```params``` section.
```
'cards' => 'http://your-endpoint.tld/path/to/repo'
```
